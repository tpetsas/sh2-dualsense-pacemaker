Are you bored of having to press a keyboard key everytime Dualsense features are devoured by another dimension of the Otherworld? You are not the only one! This might be the dumpest app in the world, but it will let you forget about those dualsense connectivity issues and focus on your game!

Silent Hill 2 Dualsense Pacemaker is just a Windows System Tray Application that sends a keystroke to Silent Hill 2 periodically (every 15 seconds) to make sure that Dualsense features are always on. Until there is a proper patch by the developer team, this is a good workaround. I'm using it all the time now and I forgot that this issue exists! ðŸ¤Ÿ

# Download & Run

Just grab the exe from the Releases:
- Framework dependent (i.e., it requires that the .NET 8.0 Runtime is installed) â€” _Recommended_
- Self-contained (This contains everything needed like dependencies, the runtime, etc., but is fairly large in size)
