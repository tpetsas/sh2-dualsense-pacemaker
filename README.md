Are you bored of having to press a keyboard key everytime Dualsense features are devoured by another dimension of the Otherworld? You are not the only one! This might be the dumpest app in the world, but it will let you forget about those dualsense connectivity issues and focus on your game!

Silent Hill 2 Dualsense Pacemaker is just a Windows System Tray Application that sends a keystroke to Silent Hill 2 periodically (every 15 seconds) to make sure that Dualsense features are always on. Until there is a proper patch by the developer team, this is a good workaround. I'm using it all the time now and I forgot that this issue exists! ðŸ¤Ÿ

# Download & Run

Just grab one of the executables:
- [**sh2-pacemaker.exe**](https://github.com/tpetsas/sh2-dualsense-pacemaker/releases/download/1.0.0/sh2-pacemaker.exe) â€” Framework dependent (i.e., it requires that the .NET 8.0 Runtime is installed) â€” **Recommended**
- [**sh2-pacemaker-self-contained.exe**](https://github.com/tpetsas/sh2-dualsense-pacemaker/releases/download/1.0.0/sh2-pacemaker-self-contained.exe) â€” (This contains everything needed like dependencies, the runtime, etc., but is **insanely** larger in size)

Just run it by double clicking on it, and you'll find it in the system tray (at the bottom right of Windows' task bar):

After finishing your game, just right click on the tray icon and choose exit:

> **Note**
> You might see the game symbols to switch to PC's now and then, but it's totally fine. I haven't noticed any issues by running this app and I totally forgot about the Dualsense connectivity issue!

Enjoy!
